## Log levels

There are 5 log levels:

1. Debug
2. Info
3. Warning
4. Error
5. Fatal

These log levels are exported by the package in the enum `LogLevel`.

Every log entry has a level, and entries with a level lower than the application's specified log level will be silently dropped instead of being logged to the standard output.

To determine the current log level, you can use `getLogLevel`:

```javascript
import Logger from 'eleventh';

const logLevel = Logger.getLogLevel();
```

The first way to set an application's log level is programmatically:

```javascript
import Logger, { LogLevel } from 'eleventh';

Logger.setLogLevel(LogLevel.debug);
// Logger.setLogLevel(LogLevel.info);
// Logger.setLogLevel(LogLevel.warning);
// Logger.setLogLevel(LogLevel.error);
// Logger.setLogLevel(LogLevel.fatal);
```

If a log level has not been programmatically set, the logger will check for a `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. This environment variable is not case sensitive, and valid values are `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, and `fatal`. For example:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=warning npm start
```

If the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable is not set, the logger will then check for a `NODE_ENV` environment variable. This environment variable is not case sensitive, and valid values are `development` and `production`. For a development environment, the log level will be set to `'info'`. For a production environment, the log level will be set to `'warning'`.

Finally, if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable has also not been specified, the logger will fall back to a default log level of `'info'`.

## Log entries

To log an entry, simply use the logger function with the name of the log level for that entry. For example:

```javascript
import Logger from 'eleventh';

Logger.debug('Skipping authentication check because user is a guest');
Logger.info('A connection to the database has been opened successfully');
Logger.warning('Memory usage is exceeding 50%');
Logger.error('Unable to parse the JSON response from the authentication API');
Logger.fatal('Unhandled exception from the file system');
```

If the level of the log entry is greater than or equal to the application's log level, it will be logged to the standard output in the following format:

```
[{timestamp}] ${level}: {message}
```

* The `{timestamp}` value is the current timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.
* The `{level}` is the all-capitalized log level of the entry.
* The `{message}` is the submitted log entry's text.

Each log entry is terminated with a new line, and the characters `\r` and `\n` within the log message will be escaped by the 2-character strings `'\r'` and `'\n'`.

Here is an example of a log with multiple entries:

```
[2021-01-21T07:51:43:0076Z] DEBUG: Skipping authentication check because user is a guest
[2021-01-21T07:51:43:0083Z] INFO: A connection to the database has been opened successfully
[2021-01-21T07:51:43:0085Z] WARNING: Memory usage is exceeding 50%
[2021-01-21T07:51:43:0086Z] ERROR: Unable to parse the JSON response from the authentication API
[2021-01-21T07:51:43:0088Z] FATAL: Unhandled exception from the file system
```

## Additional log values

It can be useful to append values to a log in addition to the message. This can easily be done with `eleventh` by supplying a record with string keys and values which are strings, numbers, or booleans (`null` and `undefined` are also accepted).

Here is an example of passing some additional log values:

```javascript
import Logger from 'eleventh';

Logger.info('An email has been sent', {
  from: 'alice@gmail.com',
  to: 'bob@gmail.com',
  title: 'Hello, world!',
  duration: 42,
  success: true,
});

// [2021-01-21T07:51:43:0076Z] INFO: An email has been sent from="alice@gmail.com" to="bob@gmail.com" title="Hello, world!" duration=42 success=true
```

# Subscribing to log entries

If you would like to subscribe to your application's logs directly rather than listening to the standard output, you can use the `subscribe` method:

```javascript
import Logger from 'eleventh';

const unsubscribe = Logger.subscribe(logEntry => {
  // An entry is being logged, and its value is provided here as `logEntry`:

  // '[2021-01-21T07:51:43:0076Z] DEBUG: Skipping authentication check because user is a guest'

  // Do not use the Logger within a subscription callback, because you will
  // trigger a recursive infinite loop.
});

Logger.info('This message will be received by the subscription');

// The returned unsubscribe function can be called to stop receiving log
// entries.
unsubscribe();
```

# Validating log levels

The function `isLogLevel` can be used to determine whether or not a given string is a valid log level. This can be useful for validating user-defined log levels within your own application.

```javascript
import { isLogLevel } from 'eleventh';

isLogLevel('critical'); // false
isLogLevel('debug'); // true
```
